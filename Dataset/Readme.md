# Dataset Information

## 🔒 Original Dataset

**Note: The original dataset used in this project cannot be shared publicly due to:**

- **Proprietary Restrictions**: The satellite imagery was obtained from Bhuvan Panchayat (ISRO), which has strict usage and distribution policies.
- **National Security Considerations**: As per ISRO and Indian government regulations, high-resolution satellite data is classified as sensitive information.
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement**: This project was conducted under an internship agreement that prohibits sharing the original data.
