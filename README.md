A deep learning-based semantic segmentation project for automated Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification from high-resolution satellite imagery, developed during my internship at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project implements a U-Net convolutional neural network for pixel-wise classification of satellite imagery into 7 distinct land cover categories. The model was trained on high-resolution satellite data from Punjab, India, to automate the creation of accurate LULC maps for applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management.

**Key Features:**
- Semantic segmentation using U-Net architecture
- Processing of high-resolution satellite imagery (3313√ó2912 pixels)
- Classification into 7 LULC categories
- Custom data preprocessing and patchification pipeline
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics

## üìã LULC Classification Categories

The model classifies each pixel into one of the following categories:
1. **Built-up Areas** - Human-made structures and urban developments
2. **Agriculture** - Crop fields, orchards, and cultivated lands
3. **Water Bodies** - Lakes, rivers, ponds, and reservoirs
4. **Wasteland** - Barren or unutilized land areas
5. **Forests** - Dense vegetation and forest covers
6. **Roads** - Transportation networks and highways
7. **Others** - Unclassified or ambiguous regions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The project utilizes a U-Net architecture with:
- **Encoder Path**: Feature extraction through convolutional and pooling layers
- **Bottleneck**: Capturing high-level abstract features
- **Decoder Path**: Feature reconstruction with transposed convolutions
- **Skip Connections**: Preserving spatial information across layers

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x, Keras
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow, Patchify
- **Data Manipulation**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Geospatial Processing**: QGIS (for ground truth annotation)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Data and Results

**Confidentiality Notice**: 
Due to strict security protocols and non-disclosure agreements with ISRO:
- The original satellite imagery and ground truth data cannot be shared publicly
- Model training results and performance metrics are confidential
- Pre-trained weights and specific evaluation results are not available for distribution
